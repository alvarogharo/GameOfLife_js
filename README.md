## The rules

Conway's Game of life rules ar basic and well known:

- Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if by underpopulation.
- Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.

- Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
